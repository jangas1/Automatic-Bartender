## Automatic Bartender

This is a project of an automated bartender with several functions which can be accessed from a menu on an LCD display. It is core function is to detect shot glasses and pour any drink (it has to be mannualy set by putting a tube into it) and count the number of shots poured on each position (it can be reseted at any time in menu postion "Drink counter"). The menu is operated using the encoder by turning it and pressing it at a given position. It has 3 submenues: "Capacity", "Drink counter" and "Pour" (which isn't really a submenu, but a button). "Capacity" submenu lets the user change the capacity of their drinks (with 5 ml step). "Drink counter" counts drink on each position and can reset the counter at any moment. "Pour" starts the automatic bartender and pours drinks on each position.
